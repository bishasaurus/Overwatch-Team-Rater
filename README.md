<h1>Overview and Key Functions</h1>

<p>This is a Overwatch fan site, where you can rate your team's competence. The app takes the team's damaging, healing, tanking and other attributes into account, and gives a review of its potential. You can then save your reviewed teams, and see their and other saved teams' rating again from the Saved teams -page. You can delete saved teams from Manage teams -page. You can also create an account in the Sign up -page, and login afterwards via Login & Account -page, so that your account's name will be visible with the teams you've created. 

Hope you can create good team compositions with Overwatch Team Rater!</p>
